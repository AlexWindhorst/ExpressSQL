The goal of this project was to create a working sales server that could gather user information as well as differentiate between a regular user and and admin user. 
There were less challenges during this tutorial compared to the local library tutorial we previously covered because the video narrator often explained the concepts I struggled to understand.
The main challenges I faced during this project were small mistakes I made while typing out the code or minor details I missed while following the tutorial. This project helped me better understand express
and I'm sure the knowledge I have gained from it will help me when developing larger scale projects in the future.
